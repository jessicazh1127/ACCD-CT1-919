    <h2>Programming Design Systems</h2>
    <p>Variations of a design can be tested much faster during the prototyping phase, and randomization can be used to reveal designs that the designer would never have created with a pencil.</p>

<p>Throwing a design over the wall for production is a bad legacy of the printed page, and there is no reason for the design process to end with the birth of a product.</p>

<p>Design systems offer a different way of thinking, where the designer is forced to consider many scenarios and constraints instead of relying on a one-off design process.</p>

<p>In code, we have the ability to procedurally generate very complex shapes in an instant, and the code required can be quite simple. On the other hand, shapes drawn randomly with a pen can be hard to recreate in code, especially if there is no underlying rule to explain the outline of the shape.</p>

<p>RGB is a color model with three dimensions red, green, and blue that are mixed to produce a specific color. When defining colors in these dimensions, one has to know the sequence of colors in the color spectrum, e.g. that a mix of 100% red and green produces yellow. The RGB color model is often depicted as a cube by mapping the red, green, and blue dimensions onto the x, y, and z axis in 3D space. This is illustrated in the interactive example below, where all possible color mixes are represented within the bounds of the cube.

<h2>What do Prototypes Prototype?</h2>
    <p>The answer depends on how it is used. If it is used to represent the weight and scale of some future artifact, then it certainly is: it prototypes the weight and scale of the artifact. This example shows that prototypes are not necessarily self-explanatory. What is significant is not what media or tools were are used to create them, but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact.</p>
        
    <p>wo related terms are used in this context: “resolution” and “fidelity”. We interpret resolution to mean “amount of detail”, and fidelity to mean “closeness to the eventual design”. It is important to recognize that the degree of visual and behavioral refinement of a prototype does not necessarily correspond to the solidity of the design, or to a particular stage in the process.</p>
    
    <p>Implementation usually requires a working system to be built; look and feel requires the concrete user experience to be simulated or actually created; role requires the context of the artifact’s use to be established. </p>
    
    <p>The model helps visualize the focus of exploration.</p>
    
    <p>The purpose of the prototype was to quickly convey the proposed role of the artifact to the design team and members of the supporting organization.</p>
    
    <p>Prototype help to ask questions.</p>
    
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Iterative design process: idea - prototype - testing - analysis - </p>

    <p>e.g. Role and life (Knowledge Navigator) - AI Assistant Siri, time slot, find articles, call people, communicate with voice, Computer, video call, share screen, shared file(co-working environment), image search, wireless printing, World Wide Web, usb, social network, auto correct.</p>

    <p> resolution ≠ High fidelity ≠ Design maturity</p>
    
    <p>The “level of detail” or “realism” of a prototype does not necessarily mean that the design itself is more mature or well-developed.</p>
    
    <p>Nor does it indicate that the design is at a specific stage in the process (for example, assuming that “high fidelity = near-final design stage” is incorrect).</p>
