    <h1>Week 4 Homework non-liner movement
       Movement of a 8-ball</h1>
    Problem 1: Non-liner movment is harder than i think to get. Those randomness is easy to achive in reallife but so hard in coding.

    Problem 2: Always showing Loading...
    I tried to figure out the what happened by console log every place there might have a problem. but still loading.
    So I brought the problem to the class, and Maxim told me it's the png's promblem, the html is not able to recognize and load, i cutout the png again by using illustrator, and the picture come up this time. I won't using the I won't be using Apple's built-in cutout feature anymore.
